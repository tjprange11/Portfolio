I played 3 years of high school hockey and played on Varsity my Senior year. I also ran Cross Country for 3 years. Over the summer I play in a softball league, which is a lot of fun. I used to play Volleyball in middle school and would love to get back into the sport because it was so much fun and i was pretty good. Lastly, I also play some ping pong.</font></div>
